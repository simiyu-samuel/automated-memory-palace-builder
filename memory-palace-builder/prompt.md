Memory Palace Builder - Complete AI Agent Development Prompt
üéØ Project Overview
Build a comprehensive Memory Palace Builder application using Laravel as the primary framework. This app automatically converts users' daily digital activities into a navigable 3D virtual palace where memories are stored as interactive objects. The system should continuously collect data from various sources, process it with AI, and render it in an immersive 3D environment.
üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack
Primary Framework:

Laravel 11 - Complete full-stack application framework
Use Laravel's built-in authentication, routing, middleware, and API capabilities

Spotify MCP Server (listening history, playlists)
Location/Maps MCP Server (GPS data, place details)
Weather MCP Server (historical weather data)

API Integration Architecture:

Create dedicated Laravel service providers for each MCP connection
Implement OAuth2 authentication flows using Laravel Socialite
Build API rate limiting and error handling using Laravel's built-in features
Store API credentials securely using Laravel's encryption

Postman Public API Network Usage:

OpenWeather API for contextual weather data
Unsplash API for default room textures
Google Places API for location enrichment
Any sentiment analysis APIs for emotional context

ü§ñ AI Processing Pipeline
Laravel Job Architecture:
Design these specific Laravel job classes:

DataCollectionJob - Fetches new data from all connected APIs
ContentAnalysisJob - Processes text content for themes and emotions
ImageProcessingJob - Analyzes photos for content and generates 3D representations
MemoryCategorizationJob - Groups related memories using ML algorithms
PalaceStructureJob - Updates 3D palace layout based on new memories
InsightGenerationJob - Creates patterns and recommendations

AI/ML Integration:

Use Laravel HTTP client to connect with external AI services
Implement local PHP ML libraries where possible
Create caching strategies for processed AI results
Build fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

üìä Database Schema Requirements
Core Tables:

users - Standard Laravel user authentication
api_connections - Store OAuth tokens and connection status
memories - Individual memory records with metadata
palace_rooms - 3D room definitions and properties
memory_objects - 3D objects representing memories in rooms
memory_relationships - Connections between related memories
processing_logs - Track AI processing status and results
user_insights - Generated patterns and recommendations

Relationship Design:

Users have many API connections
Users have many memories through API connections
Memories belong to palace rooms
Memories have many memory objects (3D representations)
Memories can have many related memories
Palace rooms contain multiple memory objects

üé® Frontend 3D Implementation
Laravel Blade + Three.js Architecture:

Create dedicated Laravel controllers for 3D data endpoints
Build JSON API responses for room structures and memory objects

User Interface Components:

Dashboard showing palace overview and statistics
Settings page for API connections and privacy controls
Search interface for finding specific memories
Timeline view for chronological memory exploration
Sharing controls for memory collaboration

üîÑ Automated Memory Creation System
Data Collection Process:

Schedule Laravel artisan commands to run data collection jobs
Implement incremental data fetching to avoid API rate limits
Create data validation and sanitization pipelines
Build duplicate detection and merging logic

Memory Processing Pipeline:

Raw data ingestion from APIs
Content analysis and sentiment detection
Category assignment and tagging
3D object generation and room placement
Relationship mapping with existing memories
Palace structure updates and optimizations

Real-time Updates:

Use Laravel Broadcasting to push palace updates to frontend
Implement WebSocket connections for live memory additions
Create notification system for significant palace changes

üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy Implementation
Data Protection:

Use Laravel's built-in encryption for sensitive data
Implement GDPR-compliant data retention policies
Create user data export functionality
Build granular privacy controls for different memory types

API Security:

Secure OAuth token storage and rotation
Implement API rate limiting and abuse prevention
Create audit logs for all data access
Build user consent management system
